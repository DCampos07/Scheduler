# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
#### A simple calendar app for scheduling your work day

This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery, and assisted by the Moment.js librare.
It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface with the following directions:
* The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
* When scrolling down then time blocks for standard business hours will be displayed.
* Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
* When clicking on a time block, then an event can be entered.
* When clicking the save button for that time block, then text for that event is saved in local storage.
* When refreshing the page, then saved events persist.
